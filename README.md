This is a demo of a simple data visualization and analysis software, specifically developed for, and run on, a specialized model of precision manufacturing equipment that used a legacy PROINSPECT vision software, which lacked data visualization capabilities. 

GapCharts handled graphing of vision system measurements, presenting relevant statistics from which mechanical abnormalities could be inferred, as well as estimating the probability of defects to guide process parameter adjustments. 

The script contains various functions for pulling data from the log of the vision system, specifically designed for the environment in which it was used, with limited applicability elsewhere.

This version was equipped with a "fake_mode" that generated random data to demonstrate the software's functionality, along with dummy recipes. It ran as-is without specific setup, aside from the required libraries.
